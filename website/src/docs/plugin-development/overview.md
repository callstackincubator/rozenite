# Plugin Development Overview

Plugins are the way to add new panels and functionalities to React Native DevTools through Rozenite. They allow you to extend the DevTools with custom debugging tools, performance monitors, and development utilities.

## What are Plugins?

Plugins are packages that integrate seamlessly with Rozenite to add custom panels and functionality to React Native DevTools. They provide a powerful way to extend the development experience with tools tailored to your specific needs.

### Key Characteristics

- **Production Ready**: Tested and optimized for real-world use
- **Type Safe**: Built with full TypeScript support
- **Well Documented**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Actively Maintained**: Regular updates and bug fixes

## How Plugins Work

### Architecture Overview

Plugins consist of two main parts:

1. **React Native Side**: Code that runs in your React Native app
2. **DevTools Side**: UI components that appear in the DevTools interface

### Communication Flow

```
React Native App ←→ Plugin Bridge ←→ DevTools Interface
```

- **Event-based Communication**: Plugins use a type-safe event system
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in your app are reflected immediately in DevTools
- **Bidirectional**: Both sending data to DevTools and receiving commands from it

### Plugin Structure

A typical plugin has this structure:

```
my-plugin/
├── src/
│   └── hello-world.tsx      # Your DevTools panels
├── react-native.ts          # React Native entry point
├── rozenite.config.ts       # Plugin configuration
├── vite.config.ts          # Build configuration
├── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
└── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
```

## Plugin Capabilities

### What You Can Build
