# React Navigation Plugin

![](/react-navigation-plugin.png)

The React Navigation plugin provides comprehensive navigation debugging and inspection for React Navigation v7, offering real-time action monitoring, state inspection, and deep linking testing directly within your React Native DevTools environment.

## What is React Navigation Plugin?

The React Navigation plugin is a powerful debugging tool that helps you inspect and debug navigation in your React Native application. It provides:

- **Action Timeline**: Track all navigation actions in real-time with detailed history
- **State Inspection**: View and analyze navigation state at any point in time
- **Time Travel Debugging**: Jump back to any previous navigation state
- **Deep Link Testing**: Test and validate deep links directly from DevTools
- **State Reset**: Reset navigation state to any previous point in the timeline
- **Real-time Updates**: See navigation changes as they happen in your app

## Installation

Install the React Navigation plugin as a development dependency:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @rozenite/react-navigation-plugin" />

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app to enable navigation debugging:

```typescript title="App.tsx"
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { useReactNavigationDevTools } from '@rozenite/react-navigation-plugin';

function App() {
  const navigationRef = useRef(null);

  // Enable React Navigation DevTools in development
  useReactNavigationDevTools({ ref: navigationRef });

  return (
    <NavigationContainer ref={navigationRef}>
      <YourAppNavigator />
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```
