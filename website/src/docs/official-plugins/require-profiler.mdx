# Require Profiler Plugin

![](/require-profiler-plugin.png)

The Require Profiler plugin instruments `require()` calls during your React Native app's initial loading to track module initialization times, helping you identify which modules impact startup performance and optimize your initial bundle loading.

## What is Require Profiler Plugin?

The Require Profiler plugin is a performance analysis tool that helps you understand and optimize your app's initial loading performance by providing:

- **Initial App Loading Profiling**: Automatically instruments `require()` calls during app startup to track initialization times
- **Flame Graph Visualization**: Interactive flame graph showing the module dependency tree with timing information
- **Startup Performance Insights**: Identify slow-loading modules that impact Time to Interactive (TTI)
- **Bundle Optimization Candidates**: Discover modules that are good candidates for code splitting or lazy loading
- **Dependency Analysis**: Visualize the complete module dependency graph loaded during initial app startup
- **Real-time Metrics**: View total initialization time, module count, and per-module evaluation times

## Installation

Make sure to go through the [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started) before installing the plugin.

Install the Require Profiler plugin as a development dependency using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @rozenite/require-profiler-plugin" />

## Configuration

### Metro Configuration

Add the require profiler instrumentation to your Metro configuration using the `enhanceMetroConfig` option in `withRozenite`:

```javascript title="metro.config.js"
const { getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig } = require('@react-native/metro-config');
const { withRozenite } = require('@rozenite/metro');
const {
  withRozeniteRequireProfiler,
} = require('@rozenite/require-profiler-plugin/metro');

const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

module.exports = withRozenite(
  mergeConfig(defaultConfig, {
    // Your existing Metro configuration
  }),
  {
    enabled: process.env.WITH_ROZENITE === 'true',
    enhanceMetroConfig: (config) => withRozeniteRequireProfiler(config),
  },
);
```

### React Native Integration

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app:

```typescript title="App.tsx"
import { useRequireProfilerDevTools } from '@rozenite/require-profiler-plugin';

function App() {
  // Enable Require Profiler DevTools
  useRequireProfilerDevTools();

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, the Require Profiler plugin will automatically appear in your React Native DevTools sidebar as "Metro Require Profiler". Click on it to access:

### Flame Graph Visualization

- **Interactive Visualization**: Navigate through your module dependency tree
- **Color-coded Timing**: Red modules indicate slow initialization (>70% of max time), blue modules indicate fast initialization
- **Zoom and Focus**: Click any module to zoom into specific parts of the dependency tree
- **Module Details**: Hover over modules to see basic information, click for detailed sidebar view

### Module Details Panel

When you click on a module in the flame graph, the sidebar shows:

- **Evaluation Time**: How long the module took to initialize
- **Module Path**: Full file path and name
- **Dependencies Count**: Number of direct dependencies
- **Parent Modules**: Which modules imported this module

### Performance Metrics

The header bar displays key performance indicators:

- **Total Initialization Time**: Sum of all module initialization times
- **Module Count**: Total number of modules loaded
- **Entry Point**: The main module that started the loading chain

## Analyzing Performance

### Identifying Slow Startup Modules

The flame graph makes it easy to spot modules that take a long time to initialize during app startup. Look for:

- **Red modules** (>70% of max time): These are your slowest modules impacting startup
- **Wide modules**: Modules that take up a lot of horizontal space in the graph
- **Deep dependency chains**: Modules that load many dependencies during initial load

### Finding Bundle Optimization Candidates

Modules that are good candidates for optimization typically:

- Take significant time to initialize (>100ms) during startup
- Are not needed immediately for the initial app experience
- Have many dependencies that could be deferred

### Optimizing App Startup Performance

By identifying and optimizing slow-loading modules, you can:

- **Reduce Initial Bundle Size**: Move heavy modules to lazy loading or code splitting
- **Improve Time to Interactive**: Prioritize critical modules and defer non-critical ones
- **Optimize Dependency Chains**: Break up large dependency trees for faster startup
- **Better Code Splitting**: Identify natural boundaries for dynamic imports

## Use Cases

### Startup Performance Optimization

```typescript
// Instead of loading heavy modules at startup:
import HeavyModule from './HeavyModule';

// Consider lazy loading or code splitting:
const HeavyModule = lazy(() => import('./HeavyModule'));

// Or use conditional/dynamic imports:
if (condition) {
  const HeavyModule = await import('./HeavyModule');
}
```

### Initial Bundle Analysis

Use the profiler to understand which parts of your codebase contribute most to initial loading time, helping you make informed decisions about:

- Which libraries to lazy load or conditionally import
- Which components to code-split for better startup performance
- Which utilities to defer until needed after initial load

### Development Workflow

- **Quick Feedback**: See immediate impact of code changes on initial app loading
- **Regression Detection**: Catch performance regressions in module initialization during startup
- **Optimization Prioritization**: Focus optimization efforts on the slowest startup modules
