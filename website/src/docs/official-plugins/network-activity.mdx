# Network Activity Plugin

The Network Activity plugin provides comprehensive network request monitoring for React Native applications, offering real-time network debugging capabilities similar to Chrome DevTools Network panel.

## What is Network Activity Plugin?

The Network Activity plugin is a powerful debugging tool that helps you monitor and analyze all network requests in your React Native application. It provides:

- **Real-time Network Monitoring**: Track all HTTP/HTTPS requests as they happen
- **Request Details**: View request headers, method, URL, and timing information
- **Response Inspection**: Examine response headers, status codes, and timing data
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze request duration, connection timing, and performance metrics
- **Request History**: Maintain a searchable history of network activity

## Installation

Install the Network Activity plugin as a development dependency using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @rozenite/network-activity-plugin" />

## Configuration

### React Native Integration

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app to enable network monitoring:

```typescript title="App.tsx"
import { useNetworkActivityDevTools } from '@rozenite/network-activity-plugin';

function App() {
  // Enable Network Activity DevTools in development
  useNetworkActivityDevTools();

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

### Metro Configuration

The Network Activity plugin works with the standard Rozenite Metro configuration:

```javascript title="metro.config.js"
const { withRozenite } = require('@rozenite/metro');

const config = {
  // Your existing Metro configuration
};

module.exports = withRozenite(config, {
  // Your Rozenite configuration
});
```

## Usage

Once configured, the Network Activity plugin will automatically appear in your React Native DevTools sidebar as "Network Activity". Click on it to access:
