# Network Activity Plugin

The Network Activity plugin provides comprehensive network request monitoring for React Native applications, offering real-time network debugging capabilities similar to Chrome DevTools Network panel.

## What is Network Activity Plugin?

The Network Activity plugin is a powerful debugging tool that helps you monitor and analyze all network requests in your React Native application. It provides:

- **Real-time Network Monitoring**: Track all HTTP/HTTPS requests as they happen
- **Request Details**: View request headers, method, URL, and timing information
- **Response Inspection**: Examine response headers, status codes, and timing data
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze request duration, connection timing, and performance metrics
- **Request History**: Maintain a searchable history of network activity

:::warning JavaScript Thread Only
The Network Activity plugin will only capture network traffic coming from the JavaScript thread. Connections made by native code (such as native networking libraries or direct platform HTTP calls) won't be displayed in the inspector.
:::

## Installation

Install the Network Activity plugin as a development dependency using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @rozenite/network-activity-plugin" />

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app to enable network monitoring:

```typescript title="App.tsx"
import { useNetworkActivityDevTools } from '@rozenite/network-activity-plugin';

function App() {
  // Enable Network Activity DevTools in development
  useNetworkActivityDevTools();

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, the Network Activity plugin will automatically appear in your React Native DevTools sidebar as "Network Activity". Click on it to access:

### Network Request List

- **Real-time Updates**: See network requests as they happen in your app
- **Request Status**: View request status (pending, completed, failed)
- **HTTP Methods**: Identify GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods
- **Response Codes**: See HTTP status codes and their meanings
- **Request Timing**: Monitor request duration and performance

### Request Details

- **Headers**: Inspect request and response headers
- **Query Parameters**: View URL parameters and their values
- **Request Body**: Examine POST/PUT request payloads
- **Response Body**: View response content and structure

## Configuration

### Ignoring Certain Types of Traffic

Sometimes you don't want certain types of traffic like WebSockets or server-side events to show up in the inspector for convenience or because of the performance penalty. You can disable them with the configuration property:

```typescript title="App.tsx"
import { useNetworkActivityDevTools } from '@rozenite/network-activity-plugin';

function App() {
  // Configure which network traffic types to monitor
  useNetworkActivityDevTools({
    inspectors: {
      http: true, // Monitor HTTP/HTTPS requests
      websocket: false, // Disable WebSocket monitoring
      sse: false, // Disable Server-Sent Events monitoring
    },
  });

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

#### Available Inspector Types

- **`http`**: Monitor HTTP/HTTPS requests (fetch, XMLHttpRequest)
- **`websocket`**: Monitor WebSocket connections and messages
- **`sse`**: Monitor Server-Sent Events (requires `http` to be enabled)
