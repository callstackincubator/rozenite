The Rozenite Redux DevTools Plugin provides Redux state inspection and debugging capabilities within your React Native DevTools environment. It offers a partial Redux DevTools experience, including state inspection and action history (time travel and action dispatch are currently unavailable in remote mode).

![Redux DevTools Plugin](https://rozenite.dev/redux-devtools-plugin.png)

## Features

- **Redux State Inspection**: View and explore your Redux store state in real-time
- **Action History**: Track all dispatched actions with timestamps and payloads
- **State Diff Viewing**: See exactly how each action changes your state
- **Production Safety**: Automatically disabled in production builds

## Installation

### 1. Install the Plugin

Install the Redux DevTools plugin and peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D @rozenite/redux-devtools-plugin
npm install react-native-get-random-values
```

**Important**: After installing `react-native-get-random-values`, you need to import it at the very top of your entry file (usually `index.js` or `App.js`):

```javascript
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
// ... rest of your imports
```

For more detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [react-native-get-random-values documentation](https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values).

### 2. Set up the Store Enhancer

Add the Redux DevTools enhancer to your Redux store:

#### For Redux Toolkit (Recommended)

```typescript
// store.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { rozeniteDevToolsEnhancer } from '@rozenite/redux-devtools-plugin';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  enhancers: (getDefaultEnhancers) =>
    getDefaultEnhancers().concat(rozeniteDevToolsEnhancer()),
});

export default store;
```

#### For Classic Redux

```typescript
// store.ts
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { rozeniteDevToolsEnhancer } from '@rozenite/redux-devtools-plugin';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(/* your middleware */),
  rozeniteDevToolsEnhancer()
);

export default store;
```

### 3. Configure Metro

Wrap your Metro configuration with `withRozeniteReduxDevTools`:

```typescript
// metro.config.js
import { withRozeniteReduxDevTools } from '@rozenite/redux-devtools-plugin/metro';

export default withRozeniteReduxDevTools({
  // your existing metro config
});
```

This setup enables the WebSocket relay that allows the Redux DevTools to communicate with your React Native app.

### 4. Access DevTools

Start your development server and open React Native DevTools. You'll find the "Redux DevTools" panel in the DevTools interface.
