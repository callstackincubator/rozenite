The Rozenite AsyncStorage Plugin provides real-time storage inspection, data visualization, and management capabilities for AsyncStorage within your React Native DevTools environment.

## Features

- **Real-time Storage Inspection**: View all AsyncStorage entries and their contents in real-time
- **Data Type Detection**: Automatically detects and displays different data types (string, number, boolean, object, array)
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find specific keys or values with real-time search functionality
- **Data Management**: Add, edit, and delete entries directly from the DevTools interface
- **Visual Data Representation**: Color-coded type indicators and formatted value display

## Installation

Install the AsyncStorage plugin as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @rozenite/async-storage-plugin
```

**Note**: This plugin requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` as a peer dependency. Make sure you have it installed:

```bash
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin

```bash
npm install @rozenite/async-storage-plugin @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

### 2. Integrate with Your App

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app:

```typescript
// App.tsx
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { useAsyncStorageDevTools } from '@rozenite/async-storage-plugin';

function App() {
  // Enable AsyncStorage DevTools in development
  useAsyncStorageDevTools(AsyncStorage);

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

### 3. Access DevTools

Start your development server and open React Native DevTools. You'll find the "AsyncStorage" panel in the DevTools interface.

## Usage

The AsyncStorage plugin automatically connects to your app's AsyncStorage instance and provides:

- **Storage Inspection**: View all stored keys with their types and values
- **Search Functionality**: Filter entries by key or value
- **Type Indicators**: Visual indicators for different data types (string, number, boolean, object, array)
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes to your AsyncStorage as they happen
- **Data Management**: Add, edit, and delete entries directly from the DevTools interface
