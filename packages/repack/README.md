The Rozenite Re.Pack plugin seamlessly integrates custom DevTools plugins into your React Native development environment. It automatically discovers installed plugins, serves them through Re.Pack's development server, and provides the necessary infrastructure for plugin communication and UI rendering.

## Features

- **Automatic Plugin Discovery**: Automatically finds and loads installed Rozenite plugins from node_modules
- **Re.Pack Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Re.Pack bundler's middleware system
- **Plugin Serving**: Serves plugin assets and panels through Re.Pack's development server
- **DevTools Frontend Integration**: Patches React Native DevTools frontend for plugin support
- **Express Middleware**: Provides custom Express middleware for plugin routing and serving
- **Configuration Options**: Flexible configuration for including/excluding specific plugins

## Installation

Install the Re.Pack plugin as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @rozenite/repack
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Setup

Add the Rozenite plugin to your Re.Pack configuration:

```javascript
// repack.config.mjs
import { withRozenite } from '@rozenite/repack';

export default withRozenite({
  // Your existing Re.Pack configuration
});
```

Or using the function style configuration:

```javascript
// repack.config.mjs
import { withRozenite } from '@rozenite/repack';

export default withRozenite((env) => ({
  // Your existing Re.Pack configuration
}));
```

### With Custom Options

Configure plugin discovery and filtering:

```javascript
// repack.config.mjs
import { withRozenite } from '@rozenite/repack';

export default withRozenite(
  {
    // Your existing Re.Pack configuration
  },
  {
    include: ['@my-org/my-plugin', 'another-plugin'],
    exclude: ['unwanted-plugin'],
  }
);
```

## Configuration

### `RozeniteRepackConfig`

The configuration object for the Re.Pack plugin:

```typescript
type RozeniteRepackConfig = {
  include?: string[]; // Only load these specific plugins
  exclude?: string[]; // Exclude these plugins from loading
};
```

**Options:**

- `include` - Array of package names to explicitly include (optional)
- `exclude` - Array of package names to exclude from loading (optional)

## Plugin Discovery

The Re.Pack plugin automatically discovers Rozenite plugins by:

1. **Scanning node_modules**: Searches all node_modules directories in the project
2. **Checking for Rozenite manifest**: Looks for the Rozenite manifest file in each package
3. **Validating plugin structure**: Ensures the plugin has the required build output
4. **Loading plugin metadata**: Extracts plugin information for integration

## Development Workflow

1. **Install plugins** in your React Native project
2. **Configure Re.Pack** with the Rozenite plugin
3. **Start Re.Pack server** - plugins are automatically discovered and loaded
4. **Access DevTools** - plugins appear in the React Native DevTools interface
5. **Develop plugins** - use hot reload for plugin development

## Plugin Requirements

For a package to be recognized as a Rozenite plugin, it must:

1. **Have a Rozenite manifest**: `dist/rozenite.json` file
2. **Be properly built**: Plugin assets must be available in the `dist` directory
3. **Follow naming conventions**: Package name should not start with `.`
4. **Be accessible**: Package must be readable from node_modules

## Troubleshooting

### No plugins found

- Ensure plugins are properly installed in `node_modules`
- Check that plugins have been built and contain `dist/rozenite.json`
- Verify plugin package names are not excluded in configuration

### Plugin not loading

- Check Re.Pack server logs for plugin discovery messages
- Verify plugin manifest file exists and is valid
- Ensure plugin assets are properly built and accessible

### Middleware conflicts

- The Rozenite middleware is designed to work alongside existing Re.Pack middleware
- Custom middleware is preserved and enhanced, not replaced
- Check for conflicts with other Re.Pack plugins

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- Re.Pack bundler
- React Native project
- Installed Rozenite plugins
