## Installation

Install the React Navigation plugin as a dependency:

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin

```bash
npm install @rozenite/react-navigation-plugin
```

### 2. Integrate with Your App

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app with a reference to your NavigationContainer:

```typescript
// App.tsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { useReactNavigationDevTools } from '@rozenite/react-navigation-plugin';

function App() {
  const navigationRef = useRef(null);

  // Enable React Navigation DevTools in development
  useReactNavigationDevTools({ ref: navigationRef });

  return (
    <NavigationContainer ref={navigationRef}>
      <YourAppNavigator />
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

### 3. Access DevTools

Start your development server and open React Native DevTools. You'll find the "React Navigation" panel in the DevTools interface.
