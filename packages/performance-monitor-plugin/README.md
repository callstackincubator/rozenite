The Rozenite Performance Monitor Plugin offers comprehensive real-time monitoring of React Native performance metrics within your DevTools environment. It's based on the `react-native-performance` library and tracks performance marks, measures, and metrics to help you identify bottlenecks and optimize your app's performance. Any marks, measures, or metrics you emit using the `react-native-performance` library will automatically appear in the DevTools interface.

## Features

- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Live tracking of performance marks, measures, and metrics
- **Session Management**: Start/stop monitoring sessions with real-time duration tracking
- **Performance Measures**: Track custom performance measurements with details
- **Performance Marks**: Monitor key performance milestones and events
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time metrics with values and details
- **Data Export**: Export performance data for analysis
- **Production Safety**: Automatically disabled in production builds

## Installation

Install the Performance Monitor plugin and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @rozenite/performance-monitor-plugin react-native-performance
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin

```bash
npm install @rozenite/performance-monitor-plugin react-native-performance
```

### 2. Integrate with Your React Native App

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app:

```typescript
// App.tsx
import { usePerformanceMonitorDevTools } from '@rozenite/performance-monitor-plugin';

function App() {
  // Enable Performance Monitor DevTools in development
  usePerformanceMonitorDevTools();

  return (
    // Your app components
  );
}
```

### 3. Access DevTools

Start your development server and open React Native DevTools. You'll find the "Performance Monitor" panel in the DevTools interface.

## Usage

### Basic Integration

The plugin automatically integrates with your existing React Native setup:

```typescript
import { usePerformanceMonitorDevTools } from '@rozenite/performance-monitor-plugin';

function App() {
  // DevTools are automatically enabled in development
  usePerformanceMonitorDevTools();

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

### Using Performance API

The plugin is based on the `react-native-performance` library and works with React Native's Performance API. Any marks, measures, or metrics you emit using the `react-native-performance` library will automatically appear in the DevTools interface. You can add custom performance marks and measures:

```typescript
import performance from 'react-native-performance';

// Add performance marks
performance.mark('app-start');
performance.mark('data-loaded');

// Measure performance between marks
performance.measure('app-initialization', 'app-start', 'data-loaded');

// Add custom metrics
performance.metric('custom-metric', 42, { detail: 'Additional info' });
```

## Performance Data Types

### Performance Marks

- **Purpose**: Mark specific points in time for performance analysis
- **Use Cases**: App startup, data loading, user interactions
- **Example**: `performance.mark('user-login-complete')`

### Performance Measures

- **Purpose**: Measure duration between two marks or specific time periods
- **Details**: Can include additional context information
- **Example**: `performance.measure('login-duration', 'login-start', 'login-end')`

### Performance Metrics

- **Purpose**: Track specific performance indicators
- **Values**: Can be strings or numbers
- **Details**: Can include additional context information
- **Example**: `performance.metric('memory-usage', 1024, { unit: 'MB' })`
