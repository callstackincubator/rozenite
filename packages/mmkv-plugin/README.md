The Rozenite MMKV Plugin provides real-time storage inspection, data visualization, and management capabilities for MMKV instances within your React Native DevTools environment.

## Features

- **Real-time Storage Inspection**: View all MMKV instances and their contents in real-time
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Manage and inspect multiple MMKV instances simultaneously
- **Data Type Detection**: Automatically detects and displays different data types (string, number, boolean, buffer)
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find specific keys with real-time search functionality
- **Visual Data Representation**: Color-coded type indicators and formatted value display

## Installation

Install the MMKV plugin as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @rozenite/mmkv-plugin
```

**Note**: This plugin requires `react-native-mmkv` as a peer dependency. Make sure you have it installed:

```bash
npm install react-native-mmkv
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin

```bash
npm install @rozenite/mmkv-plugin react-native-mmkv
```

### 2. Integrate with Your App

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app:

```typescript
// App.tsx
import { useMMKVDevTools } from '@rozenite/mmkv-plugin';

function App() {
  // Enable MMKV DevTools in development
  useMMKVDevTools();

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

### 3. Access DevTools

Start your development server and open React Native DevTools. You'll find the "MMKV Storage" panel in the DevTools interface.

## Usage

The MMKV plugin automatically detects all MMKV instances in your app and provides:

- **Instance Selection**: Choose which MMKV instance to inspect from a dropdown
- **Key-Value Display**: View all stored keys with their types and values
- **Search Functionality**: Filter entries by key name
- **Type Indicators**: Visual indicators for different data types (string, number, boolean, buffer)
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes to your MMKV storage as they happen
