The Rozenite MMKV Plugin provides real-time storage inspection, data visualization, and management capabilities for MMKV instances within your React Native DevTools environment.

![MMKV Plugin](https://rozenite.dev/mmkv-plugin.png)

## Features

- **Real-time Storage Inspection**: View all MMKV instances and their contents in real-time
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Manage and inspect multiple MMKV instances simultaneously
- **Data Type Detection**: Automatically detects and displays different data types (string, number, boolean, buffer)
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find specific keys with real-time search functionality
- **Visual Data Representation**: Color-coded type indicators and formatted value display
- **Blacklist Filtering**: Filter out sensitive data or large binary blobs using regex patterns

## Installation

Install the MMKV plugin as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @rozenite/mmkv-plugin
```

**Note**: This plugin requires `react-native-mmkv` as a peer dependency. Make sure you have it installed:

```bash
npm install react-native-mmkv
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin

```bash
npm install @rozenite/mmkv-plugin react-native-mmkv
```

### 2. Integrate with Your App

Add the DevTools hook to your React Native app and provide your MMKV instances:

```typescript
// App.tsx
import { MMKV } from 'react-native-mmkv';
import { useMMKVDevTools } from '@rozenite/mmkv-plugin';

// Create your MMKV instances
const userStorage = new MMKV({ id: 'user-storage' });
const appSettings = new MMKV({ id: 'app-settings' });
const cacheStorage = new MMKV({ id: 'cache-storage' });

function App() {
  // Enable MMKV DevTools with your storage instances
  useMMKVDevTools({
    storages: [userStorage, appSettings, cacheStorage],
  });

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

**With blacklist filtering:**

```typescript
function App() {
  // Enable MMKV DevTools with RegExp blacklist for sensitive/large data
  useMMKVDevTools({
    storages: [userStorage, appSettings, cacheStorage],
    blacklist: /cache-storage:.*Binary.*|user-storage:sensitiveToken|.*:temp.*/,
  });

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

### 3. Access DevTools

Start your development server and open React Native DevTools. You'll find the "MMKV Storage" panel in the DevTools interface.

**Important Note:** You must explicitly provide all MMKV instances you want to inspect to the `useMMKVDevTools` hook. The plugin cannot automatically detect MMKV instances - only the storages you pass in the `storages` array will be available in the DevTools interface.

## Blacklist Filtering

The MMKV plugin supports filtering out specific properties using regex patterns. This is useful for:

- **Performance**: Hide large binary blobs that slow down DevTools
- **Security**: Filter sensitive data like tokens, passwords, or personal information
- **Development**: Hide temporary or debug data

### Blacklist Pattern Format

The blacklist parameter accepts a JavaScript RegExp object matched against `{storageId}:{key}` format:

```typescript
useMMKVDevTools({
  storages: [userStorage, cacheStorage],
  blacklist: /cache-storage:.*Binary.*|user-storage:sensitiveToken|.*:temp.*/,
});
```

This RegExp will hide:

- Any key containing "Binary" in cache-storage (`cache-storage:.*Binary.*`)
- The exact key "sensitiveToken" in user-storage (`user-storage:sensitiveToken`)
- Any key containing "temp" in any storage (`.*:temp.*`)

The `|` character is the regex OR operator to combine multiple patterns.

## Usage

Once you've provided your MMKV instances to the plugin, it provides:

- **Instance Selection**: Choose which MMKV instance to inspect from a dropdown
- **Key-Value Display**: View all stored keys with their types and values
- **Search Functionality**: Filter entries by key name
- **Type Indicators**: Visual indicators for different data types (string, number, boolean, buffer)
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes to your MMKV storage as they happen
- **Data Management**: Add, edit, and delete entries directly from the DevTools interface
- **Type-aware Editing**: Input validation based on data types when editing entries
