# Playground

This app uses React Native Community CLI so make sure you have your [environment setup to build native apps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

You can then use Xcode/Android Studio/Gradle to build application or run `pnpm nx start playground` and `pnpm nx run-ios playground`/`pnpm nx run-android playground` to start development server and run applications in development mode.
