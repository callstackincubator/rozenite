# Playground

This app uses React Native Community CLI, so make sure you have your [environment setup to build native apps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

You can then use Xcode/Android Studio/Gradle to build applications, or run `pnpm start:playground` and `pnpm start:playground:ios`/`pnpm start:playground:android` to start the development server and run applications in development mode.

You can also start the development server from the root workspace by executing `pnpm start:playground`.
