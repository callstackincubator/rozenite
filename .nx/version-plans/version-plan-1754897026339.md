Introduces the 'enhanceMetroConfig 'configuration property, designed to apply Metro config plugins like Expo Atlas and Redux DevTools. Unlike the previous method, the function passed to this property wonâ€™t run during bundling, which helps prevent the Metro process from hanging indefinitely with certain plugins (such as Redux DevTools).
