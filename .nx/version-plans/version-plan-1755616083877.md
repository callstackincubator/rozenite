The useRozeniteDevToolsClient hook is reinitialized during the hot reload of the host component, and a new client should be created at that point. However, due to the persistent client cache, the previous client was reused instead. The issue arose because the useEffect cleanup function disposes of the client. When the same client was reused, no messages were received.
