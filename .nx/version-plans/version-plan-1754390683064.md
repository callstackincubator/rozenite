'@rozenite/middleware': prerelease
---

Added React Native version verification to prevent Rozenite from starting on unsupported versions, improving user experience by providing clear feedback when the tool doesn't load in older React Native DevTools. Enhanced logging capabilities through the introduction of ROZENITE_DEBUG environment variable, enabling additional logging for dependency resolution processes.
