'@rozenite/react-navigation-plugin': prerelease
---

This version introduces a new Navigation Tree tab to enhance state visualization in the developer tools. Instead of relying on raw JSON data, the navigation state will now be displayed as an interactive stack of screens, navigators, and tab navigators, allowing clearer insight into navigation flows and history. Developers can view how navigation states evolve over time, distinguish between screens and navigators through color coding, and identify the currently selected screen within tab navigators.
