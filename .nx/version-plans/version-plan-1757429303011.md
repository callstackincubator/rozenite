'@rozenite/metro': prerelease

Unfortunately, the React Native ecosystem is so diverse that it's difficult to keep up with all the ways Metro is invoked by the React Native CLI and Expo. Instead of constantly chasing edge cases and adding new scripts to the "probably bundling" list, users will now be able to conditionally enable Rozenite in development by providing the enabled option. This option can be set via an environment variable - for example, if ROZENITE_ENABLED is set, the option will be true. This change will significantly reduce maintenance overhead and make Rozenite even more versatile.
