'@rozenite/network-activity-plugin': prerelease
---

In this version, we're introducing the ability to override and mock network responses, inspired by Chrome DevTools. This feature enables developers to modify response bodies and statuses to observe how their applications react, without making any backend changes. It's a practical way to prototype, test, and validate fixes or enhancements while waiting on backend or third-party updates, helping you maintain momentum and streamline your development workflow.
