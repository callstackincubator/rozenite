This pull request fixes an issue where promises started in message handlers were significantly delayed, sometimes by nearly 10 seconds. The exact cause is unknown, but I suspect itâ€™s related to them originating from the 'execute code' action on the DevTools side. A similar issue was previously observed during domain initialization. The same fix has been applied, and it appears to be working correctly now.
